# Meteor Slack (Now called [SpaceTalk](http://github.com/SpaceTalk/SpaceTalk))

A chat application made in 25 steps, and designed to look a little bit like Slack.

> With channels for multiple users, markdown, gravatar, an autosizing textarea and a list of channels in a sidebar.

## Disclaimer

This code is part of the Meteor Workshop that takes place on the 14th of May 2015 in Gothenburg Sweden.

It was made solely do demonstrate the efficiency and the simple nature of Meteor.

## Prerequisites

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install)

## Getting started

Clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:studiointeract/meteor-slack.git
```

We created the code for this step just by calling ```meteor create meteor-slack``` in the terminal (console) and then added what was generated to the repo on the master branch (excluding this awesome README).
